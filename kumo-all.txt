    Shinohara was actually a furry, and that's why she got reincarnated as a dragon-wyrm-thing; because that was her fursona.
    <em>(Please, I really want a fursona for Shinohara to put here.)</em>
  }}

    that power.
  }}

  {{Classroom Games
    This world is actually just a game that Shunsuke, Kanata, and his friends are playing. Hugo is really jealous that they're plaing

  {{D = Death
    <p>D is the god of Death; a Grim Reaper of sorts.</p>
    <p>This actually has a lot of supporting evidence, what with Shiro's scythe, and some of the things that Meido says to D.</p>

  {{The System is a Godcradle
    One of the goals of the System was to try to artifically create a God out of a creature that isn't usually able to become one.

  {{Kumoko = Rihoko
    Kumoko's identity prior to reincarnation was the girl who was called 'Rihoko'. She mentions how she was bullied, and
    we know that Rihoko was bullied in the past. She also calls herself ugly, which fits with the meaning of the nickname, 
    which was created to make fun of her appearence.

  {{61 Dustins
    Each time Dustin 'reincarnates', he doesn't <em>actually</em> reincarnate, instead the System simply copies his memories

    with distinct souls.

    Sariel is actually in love with Shun, and is thus giving him preferential treament in the System.

    'damsel in distress' to have ever existed.
  }}

  {{Demonic Origins
    The humans are all descendants of demons who went though some genetic changes, just as the Neanderthals were to Homo Sapiens.

    The vast majority of the people in the system are nothing more than NPCs, and are there just to fill the world for the
    few actual souls that remain.

  {{Forbidden Crush
    <em>Unknown.</em>  
  }}

  {{Potimas.exe
    Potimas uploaded his consciousness into the System. He can use that to move into anyone that has a fragment of his soul
    due to his Ruler skill. I mean, the fucker <em>did</em> create robots out of child brains.
    <span style="font-size:50%">I guess he fancied himself a contemporary Armstrong.</span>
  }}

  {{Sue the Reincarnation
    <p>Sue is a stalker who followed Shun religiously in their previous life, and was, unluckily for her, peeking in to the
    classroom at the time of the explosion. Her genius is because she herself is a reincarnation like Shun and Katia.</p>
    <p>D gave her no unique skills, because she would be the only female family member that Shun would have in his life, and
    D figured that was more than enough for her.</p>
    <p>She was also never under Hugo's mind control, and was instead simply playing along to allow her to get even closer to
    Shun.</p>

    The world was, just as he had thought, entirely Hugo's dream.
