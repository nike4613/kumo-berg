    Shinohara was actually a furry, and that's why she got reincarnated as a dragon-wyrm-thing; because that was her fursona.
    <em>(Please, I really want a fursona for Shinohara to put here.)</em>

  {{Wakaba RPG
    Wakaba made an RPG in memory of her recently deceased classmates, and the 'reincarnations' are just AIs programmed
    to act like them.

    Kanata was gay for Shunsuke, and so reincarnated as his girlfriend so they could finally be together.

    Ariel and Ozen look visually similar, and the Abyss is, in many ways, reminiscint of the Labyrinth. Perhaps Kumo Desu
    just takes place earlier in their shared timeline?

    The 'Saint' title has a hidden world-ending function. Yuri was so heavily indoctrinated so that the Pope could one day control
    that power.

  {{Classroom Games
    This world is actually just a game that Shunsuke, Kanata, and his friends are playing. Hugo is really jealous that they're plaing

  {{Kumoko = Rihoko
    Kumoko's identity prior to reincarnation was the girl who was called 'Rihoko'. She mentions how she was bullied, and
    we know that Rihoko was bullied in the past. She also calls herself ugly, which fits with the meaning of the nickname, 
    which was created to make fun of her appearence.

  {{Yuri is Shiraori
    After accidentally gaining Taboo knowledge, Yuri goes <em>even more</em> crazy, turning her eyes red and turning against
    the church in an act of self-preservation. Eventually, she would ascend to godhood due only to how much this warped her soul.

    Remnants of an ancient civilization can be found deep below the surface on this planet.

    GÃ¼rie was either one of those reincarnated that were not accounted for by Oka, or was another student in the same grade.

    One of the goals of the System was to try to artifically create a God out of a creature that isn't usually able to become one.

  {{61 Dustins
    Each time Dustin 'reincarnates', he doesn't <em>actually</em> reincarnate, instead the System simply copies his memories
    into a new person each time because of Perseverance. As such, there have been 61 Dustins in the history of this world, each
    with distinct souls.

    Merazofis is actually just the first Demon King and Vampire Progenitor Foddway.

  {{Sariel's True Love
    Sariel is actually in love with Shun, and is thus giving him preferential treament in the System.
    She forced the title of Hero onto him despite Shiraori's complaints, hoping that he will save her, possibly the greatest
    'damsel in distress' to have ever existed.

    The humans are all descendants of demons who went though some genetic changes, just as the Neanderthals were to Homo Sapiens.

    The vast majority of the people in the system are nothing more than NPCs, and are there just to fill the world for the
    few actual souls that remain.

    Potimas uploaded his consciousness into the System. He can use that to move into anyone that has a fragment of his soul

  {{Sue the Reincarnation
    <p>Sue is a stalker who followed Shun religiously in their previous life, and was, unluckily for her, peeking in to the
    classroom at the time of the explosion. Her genius is because she herself is a reincarnation like Shun and Katia.</p>
    <p>D gave her no unique skills, because she would be the only female family member that Shun would have in his life, and
    D figured that was more than enough for her.</p>
    <p>She was also never under Hugo's mind control, and was instead simply playing along to allow her to get even closer to
    Shun.</p>

  {{Mother's Kin Control
    Kumoko never actually broke free from Kin Control, and she only thought she did. Her parallel wills were heavily affected
    by Mother, and eventually the Vestiges annihilated the majority of the Dragons in the Labyrinth, which was exactly the
    kind of thing that Mother would have wanted. Even after ascending, she was likely still affected by that, as shown by her
    hatred of GÃ¼rie, a True Dragon.
  }}

  {{Fake Reincarnations
    The 'reincarnations' are actually artifical souls created by Potimas as a way to experiment with the limits the System
    put on him. He hacked into the System to help him create those souls, and wanted to use them as puppets to gain control
    over the Church, but ended up not being able to maintain control over them.
  }}

  {{Spiders, the lot of them!
    All of the reincarnators were originally spiders, and the attack that killed them only hit a spider mother and her young.

  {{Dimension Magic
    Earth and the System are in different dimensions, and Shiraori and D are just able to easily jump between them.
    This may be why the phone conversations with D had a lot of static.

  {{Hiiro Conundrum
    D is <em>not</em> Wakaba Hiiro, but instead consumed a large part of her soul and turned the rest into a spider during the
    reincarnation.

  {{D, the White Weaver
    <p>D is Shiraori from the future, returning as a way to entertain herself. Shiraori is mysteriously attracted to D,
    indicating that there may be a deep connection of that sort, along with D taking rather particular interest in Shiraori.</p>
    <p>In addition, D's hatred of Dragons is very much like Shiraori's.</p>
    <p>It would be very likely then, that Meido was future Sophia, and that Angels might be Potimas's remaining robots at some
    point in the future. Even the True Dragons may be decendents of GÃ¼rie's 'fake' dragons.</p>

  {{Godegg Theory
    The System is a "godegg", a structure that houses D's soul from different timelines, across reincarnations to accumulate
    experience so she can reach true godhood. This is based on the short story "The Egg" by Andy Weir, available
    <a href="http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">here</a>.

  {{The Price of Mercy
    The use of the Mercy skill sacrifices other people in the System to perform its resurrection. Because of the sheer amount

    Sariel and D are actually the same person.

    Sariel is the kin of D, just as Shiro is.

  {{Purgatory
    The System planet is actually Purgatory, managed by D. She is responsible for an "underworld", and so it is likely that
    she created the system as a form of purgatory to place souls which deserved punishment, but didn't need to go to her hell.
    The system's erosion of the souls in it is the primary punishment.

    Sariel is an AI created by Potimas to help him kill GÃ¼rie.

    D doesn't actually intend on letting the reincarnations' souls go back to the normal cycle, and is instead just using them
    to fuel the System.

  {{Motherbot 54R13L
    The real Sariel died long ago, and got replaced by a robot.

  {{Araba was an Inside Job
    Araba intentionally helped Kumoko by sparing her life to motivate her to struggle on, as well as showing that the option
    to sacrifice your skills existed. That, in particular, would become a major part of Shiraori's plan.

  {{Fake Fei
    Fei is not Shinohara, her memories just got imprinted onto a wyrm's soul while the real Shinohara is a True Dragon who lived
    on Earth with D. She bullied Wakaba because she knew they weren't allowed to use their magecraft on Earth. This bullying is
    why D hates True Dragons.

  {{GÃ¼rie the Lover-Killer
    GÃ¼rie wants Sariel to die because he raped her while she was stuck in the System's nexus, and is now afraid that she will
    break free and tell people about that.
  }}

  {{The God of Earth
    The entire story is written by D, under the pseudonym Okina Baba. This also implies that Meido would be using the pseudonym
    Tsukasa Kiryuu, since they seem to be fairly close friends.

  {{Evil Shun
    Shun is extremely twisted, and puts up his "good guy" act to achieve his goals. When he eventually obtained Mercy, as part
    of his plan, his personality was warped even further, which he didn't account for.

    Kumoko's Mother wanted to die to break away from the Demon Lord's control. She spared Kumoko's life several times, as well
    as helping her along in some cases.

  {{There Is No Spider
    The spider that Kumoko was said to be the reincarnation of never existed. Instead, Shiraori <em>is</em> in fact Wakaba,
    D just convinced her otherwise. D lied that she was hiding from Meido as Wakaba. Instead, she used the explosion as cover
    to allow her to hide out on Earth, pretending that there was in fact a survivor in the form of Wakaba.

    Snailbugs, if they evolve enough, turn into massively over-powered world-ending monsters.

  {{The Great Snailbug
    The Elroe Great Labyrinth is a massive snailbug corpse, possibly of an ascended snailbug. They get larger with evolution,
    and so it is possible that one of the first snailbugs had grown to a massive size before being killed by the first Hero and
    Demon Lord.

    Wakaba was actually kin of the Great Snailbug God in the past, but after being killed in the explosion, D convinced her that
    she was, in fact, a spider.

    <ul>
      <li>Eating 7 snailbugs lets you instantly ascend to godhood.</li>

    The planet the System is on was originally flat, but Potimas used MA energy to reshape it into a geoid like other planets.
