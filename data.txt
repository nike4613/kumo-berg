  Any lines without any prefix (like >, $, [[, ]], {{, or }}) are ignored, except within {{ }} blocks.
In those blocks, such text is rendered as the body of the details view.

See kumo-all.txt for a complete file using all current features.

  Set the background to scroll at 1/2 the speed as the foreground. The number represents the scroll ratio
as the background scroll speed over the foreground scroll speed. It may also be specified as a JSON object
with a property 'z' and 'p', where the equivalent scroll ratio is given by p / (z + p).

$ parallax 0.5

Note that on Chromium, the user may be able to scroll past the end of the image. This is a Blink bug.
This won't be noticable unless you do not have enough sections to fill the image at your scroll ratio.

  The $ line prefix can be used to set any option, and they always take the form `$ name jsonValue` where
jsonValue is valid JSON. The name can be anything, and does not have to have a space before the $. There must
be a space after the name.

  Set the title text. This does not set the tab title. This is rendered as HTML above the first section.
This is special syntax for setting the 'title' option to the string following the >.

>The Iceberg

That is exactly equivalent to this:

$ title "The Iceberg"

  Start a (nameless) section. All text following the delimiter will be rendered as HTML on the right of the section.
Often, this will be an image. If it is, give it the class 'section-image' to ensure that it has a reasonable size.
[[
    Start a theory description named 'PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!'. This is shown in the unexpanded detail prompt, with
  a solid background, in a monospace font. The content of the block is also rendered as HTML.
  {{PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!
    <h2>Welcome to the Iceberg!</h2>

      This was created as ameans of presenting rediculous theories about <em>Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?</em>
      so that both their name and explanation is easily available. There are several variants, each targeting
      an audience with a different level of knowledge about the series. Some theories may give <em>extremely</em>
      large spoilers, so read them at your own risk. Generally speaking, avoid the icebergs that are for people
      following an older medium.

      As of the writing of this (mid-February, 2021), this means that, if you are up to date with a given medium,
      you can safely check out the lists for any medium listed to its left: 
    </p>
    <code>
      Anime < Manga < Light Novel (EN) < Light Novel (JP) < Web Novel
    </code>
    <p>
      As the web novel is the furthest along in the series, it contains the most spoilers for anyone earlier.
      We <em>strongly</em> recommend that you don't spoil yourself, as much of the entertainment of the series
      comes from the way it presents information over time.
