    <h2>Welcome to the Iceberg!</h2>
    <p>
      This was created as ameans of presenting rediculous theories about <em>Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?</em>
      so that both their name and explanation is easily available. There are several variants, each targeting
      an audience with a different level of knowledge about the series. Some theories may give <em>extremely</em>
      large spoilers, so read them at your own risk. Generally speaking, avoid the icebergs that are for people
      following an older medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of the writing of this (mid-February, 2021), this means that, if you are up to date with a given medium,
      you can safely check out the lists for any medium listed to its left: 
    </p>
    <code>
      Anime < Manga < Light Novel (EN) < Light Novel (JP) < Web Novel
    </code>
    <p>
      As the web novel is the furthest along in the series, it contains the most spoilers for anyone earlier.
      We <em>strongly</em> recommend that you don't spoil yourself, as much of the entertainment of the series
      comes from the way it presents information over time.
